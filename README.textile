AKAMAI_API is a collection of AKAMAI webservices proxy classes whose aim is to convert wsdl format in a more easy-to-write, modern and human readable format.

At the moment only three web services and a handful of methods are defined:

h4. CCU (purge requests)

 - purge

h4. ECCU (advanced purge requests)

 - get_ids
 - get_info
 - set_notes
 - set_notify_email
 - delete
 - upload

h4. SITE ACCELERATOR

 - cp_codes


h3. Configuration

It uses Savon to communicate with akamai. Configure savon to customize it. e.g.

bc. #configure statements
Savon.configure do |config|
  config.log = false            # disable logging
  config.log_level = :error     # changing the log level
end
